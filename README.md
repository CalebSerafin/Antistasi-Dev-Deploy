# How To
But if you take it right now put it in your respority root folder (same folder the git ignore is in). Run it once, press `y`, it will open up the config location. Open template.selected.cfg and navigate to the line `A3Profile=FrostsBite;`. Replace `FrostsBite` with the profile name you launch Arma 3 with.

Now evertime you run A3DD, it will create mission files inside your mpmissions with the same name as the mission template folders in Antisatsi/Templates (ie `A3-Antistasi.altis`). Now you can run these missions inside multi-player LAN host 

If you want copy these files somewhere else, go to documents/Arma 3 - Other Profiles/MyProfileName/mpmissions.
